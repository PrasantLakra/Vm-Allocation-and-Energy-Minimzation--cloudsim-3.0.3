# Vm-Allocation-and-Energy-Minimzation--cloudsim-3.0.3
Vm Allocation and Energy Minimization using Cloudsim v3.0.3 intregrated with eclipse


We used the Eclipse IDE (Integrated Development Environment) version 
4.29.0, Cloud Sim Framework Version 3.0.3, Java Development Kit Version 20, Java Language.

a) Metrics Used: During our deployment, we focus on evaluating significant metrics including virtual 
machine migration, energy consumption, and energy efficiency. These evaluations provide valuable 
data about the effectiveness and performance of virtual machine allocation techniques under various 
workload scenarios. 

b) Challenges Faced: During the deployment process, we had to figure out how to balance energy 
efficiency and performance, as well as how to handle scaling issues while maintaining real-time data 
availability. Also, it required rigorous problem-solving and calculated decision making to get through 
the challenges and ensure the reliability and effectiveness of our execution.
